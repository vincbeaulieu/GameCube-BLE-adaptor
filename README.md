# GameCube-BLE-adaptor
Bluetooth adaptor for your GameCube. An external adaptor that will allow you to connect a bluetooth controller to the NGC socket of your GameCube or Wii and enjoy the freedom of wireless. 

This project will be towards the development of a Bluetooth receiver for the NGC port of the GameCube / Wii. Allowing bluetooth controller such as the Nintendo Switch Bluetooth GameCube controller to be compatible with the GameCube and Wii console.

A lot of the code regarding the communication protocol of the GameCube controler has been reverse engineered and is available to mod a standard wired GameCube controller and turn it into a bluetooth one [1]. However, this mod only work for bluetooth compatible devices, rendering the new moded controller incompatible with the Nintendo GameCube / Wii.
