# GameCube-BLE-adaptor
Bluetooth adaptor for your GameCube. An external adaptor that will allow you to connect a bluetooth controller to the NGC socket of your GameCube or Wii and enjoy the freedom of wireless. 

The code regarding the communication protocol of the GameCube controler has been reverse engineered and is available online. The existing code turns a standard wired GameCube controller into a bluetooth one. However, this mod only works for bluetooth compatible devices, rendering the new moded controller incompatible with the GameCube / Wii consoles. [1]

This project will be towards the development of a Bluetooth receiver for the NGC port of the GameCube and Wii consoles. Allowing bluetooth controller such as the Nintendo Switch Bluetooth GameCube controller to be compatible with these old consoles.
